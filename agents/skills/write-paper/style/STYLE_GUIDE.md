# STYLE_GUIDE — house style for a mathematics paper

This is the **generic baseline** house style the `write-paper` pipeline writes
to. It contains no author-specific anchors and quotes no specific paper.

Read it in two layers:

- **§0 is the non-negotiable floor** — the integrity rules (preserve the
  mathematics, cite honestly, never fabricate a reference, leak no pipeline
  metadata). These live in the role contract (`roles/AGENTS.md`, the PRIME
  DIRECTIVE) and **always** hold, independent of any field, venue, or preference;
  §0 below only points there.
- **§1 onward are the default house style for a mathematics paper** — concrete
  typographic and structural conventions (document class, macros, theorem/proof
  shape, citation form). They are sensible **defaults**, not universal law: they
  assume an AMS-style mathematics article, and a different venue or subfield may
  legitimately want others. They are **configurable** — edit this file, or override
  per paper.

The operator may edit this file to encode their own preferences, and may drop
gold-standard exemplar papers under `style/anchors/` for the writer to imitate
(see `style/README.md`). Where an anchor or a `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` per-paper rule
is more specific than a default here, the more specific one wins — except the §0
floor, which always holds.

## 0. Non-negotiable floor

The integrity floor — **preserve all mathematics and invent nothing; preserve and
properly `\cite` every reference; fabricate no bibliography; leak no internal
pipeline identifier** (the automated-system disclosure in
`boilerplate/acknowledgement.md` is the one intended exception) — is the **PRIME
DIRECTIVE in `roles/AGENTS.md` (items 1–6)**, binding on every role. It always
holds, even against an anchor or a per-paper override. It is stated once, there,
and not repeated in full here so the two cannot drift.

## Mathematical writing standards

These are standing requirements for every mathematical draft, revision,
reference audit, reference verification, and whole-paper mathematical
verification report. Role-specific prompts and project briefs may make them
stricter, but may not weaken them.

- **Cite generously and precisely.** Attribute borrowed ideas, constructions,
  methods, and results, not only quoted theorem statements. Prefer original
  sources and identify relevant later developments when they help the reader;
  distinguish established work from the present contribution. For a result
  used in a proof, give the theorem, proposition, section, or page whenever it
  is available, and verify that its hypotheses and conclusion match the use.
  Never invent a reference or theorem number. Mark any reference whose exact
  support has not been checked as unverified. Generous citation means proper
  credit and useful guidance, not unrelated bibliography padding.

- **Concentrate effort on the nontrivial steps.** Give priority to researching,
  checking, and explaining the difficult or decisive arguments. State the main
  obstruction, the idea that overcomes it, and why the argument works. Make
  essential hypotheses, norms, uniformity, parameter dependence, and limiting
  procedures explicit. Keep routine calculations brief or replace them with
  precise references, while retaining enough information to check the
  argument. Never hide a substantive gap behind words such as “standard,”
  “clearly,” or “by approximation.” This allocation of detail follows the
  mathematical-writing advice in Terry Tao's [Give appropriate amounts of
  detail](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/give-appropriate-amounts-of-detail/).

- **Write clearly and concisely.** Organize the paper around the logical
  structure of the proof rather than the chronology of discovery. Explain how
  the main lemmas contribute to the theorem. Use consistent notation, direct
  sentences, and only definitions and intermediate results that serve the
  argument. Remove repetition, generic motivation, unnecessary abstraction,
  and excessive treatment of elementary steps. Shortening must never change a
  quantifier, suppress a necessary assumption, turn a conditional claim into a
  theorem, or conceal a genuine gap.

These operator requirements take precedence over conflicting house-style
defaults. Concision permits removing redundant exposition while preserving
mathematical content, essential assumptions, and checkable justification.
<!-- END OPERATOR MATHEMATICAL WRITING STANDARDS -->

## 1. Document class and preamble

These are the defaults for an AMS-style mathematics article; a `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`
override or a different venue's class may replace them (the §0 floor still holds).

- `\documentclass{amsart}` by default (11pt or 12pt acceptable). A `geometry` block
  for margins is fine. Use the venue's class when the brief names one.
- Preserve every package and macro already present in the input preamble
  (`hyperref`, `\definecolor`, custom `\newcommand`, `\theoremstyle`,
  `\DeclareMathOperator`, package options). You may ADD a missing package; never
  silently DROP one.
- Theorem environments via `amsthm`: a shared counter
  (`\newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}[section]`, then `\newtheorem{lem}[thm]{Lemma}`,
  `prop`, `cor`, `defn`, `rem`, `conj`, etc.). Use `\theoremstyle{plain}` for
  results and `\theoremstyle{definition}`/`remark` where appropriate.
- First-page elements: `\subjclass[2020]{...}` and `\keywords{...}` present;
  `\date{}` left empty unless the operator wants a date.

## 2. Macro architecture

- Define a canonical macro set in the preamble and use it consistently:
  `\mathbb`, `\mathcal`, `\mathbf`, `\mathfrak` shorthands and
  `\operatorname{}` / `\DeclareMathOperator` for multi-letter operators. Do not
  hand-typeset a multi-letter operator in plain italics.
- `\epsilon` always; never `\varepsilon`.
- `\colon` for the colon in a map `f\colon X\to Y`; `\mid` for the bar in
  set-builder notation; `\setminus` for set difference.
- Editorial macros are neutral and locked: `\edit{}`, `\note{}`, `\todo{}` for
  in-draft annotations. Define them in the preamble; never drop them and never
  define them as no-ops. Do not invent person-named editorial macros.

## 3. Theorem statements

- A theorem statement is fully quantified and self-contained: every symbol it
  uses is defined before it, defined inline right after, or forward-referenced.
  No naked symbols.
- Use `Let`, `Suppose`, and `Assume` for distinct roles, consistently: `Let $X$ be ...` introduces a fresh object (variable, space, map); `Suppose that ...` opens a proof by contradiction or a case-split assumption; `Assume that ...` states a standing hypothesis inside a theorem statement or a side hypothesis inside a proof.
- Theorem titles (the bracketed `[...]` argument) are in accessible English,
  with no symbol-only prefix. When restating a known result, the title cites the
  predecessor.
- Use lettered statements (`\begin{thm}` labelled A, B, ...) for headline
  results in the introduction when the paper has several; number ordinary body
  results.
- State hypotheses and conclusions as displayed lists (`enumerate`) when there
  are several; keep one logical clause per item.

## 4. Proofs

- Choose deliberately between a cohesive prose proof, a multi-step proof, or an
  extracted-lemma cluster, by the length and structure of the argument.
- Do not dispatch a proof with `by the same arguments`, `by similar arguments`, or `by standard arguments`. Either spell the argument out or extract the shared content as a lemma. A pointer of the form `the proof is similar to that of [Cite], with the substitution: ...` is acceptable only when the argument is verbatim after a single explicit substitution and reproducing it would require copying a long external proof; the substitution must be made explicit.
- For a multi-step proof, open with a one-paragraph setup, then
  `\noindent\textbf{Step N.}` steps; each step opens with a one-sentence preview
  of what it establishes.
- Prove an embedded `Claim` immediately where it is stated; do not defer it.
- Reductions read `Possibly replacing $X$ with $Y$, we may assume that ...`,
  with the equivalence stated first. Do not write "WLOG" or "without loss of
  generality".
- One mathematical claim per sentence. Each non-obvious assertion is justified
  by a formula, an internal `\ref`, or a `\cite` — never by an unsupported
  adverb.
- `Note that` / `Notice that` / `Observe that` may draw attention to a fact, but the fact must still be justified — it is an immediate consequence of something already stated or cited, is followed by a brief justification, or is the conclusion of a displayed calculation. Drawing attention is never a license to skip the proof.

## 5. Citations and bibliography

- Manual `\begin{thebibliography}{99}` with hand-written `\bibitem[KEY]{KEY}`
  entries (amsalpha-like keys); **no BibTeX**. Sort entries by author surname,
  not by the label string.
- Many-author keys use the `[Abc$^+$YY]` superscript-plus form.
- Cite at the right granularity: for a specific claim from a book or long paper,
  cite the theorem/proposition/chapter number, e.g. `\cite[Theorem~1.5]{Key}`.
- When a result has both an originating reference and a later proof, cite both
  with their roles clear.
- Replace a stale external citation with an internal `Theorem~\ref{thm:...}`
  once the result is proved internally (keeping genuine credit attribution).
- A Background paragraph that introduces an established framework carries a
  roll-call citation cluster (a handful of references) rather than a single
  token cite.
- Never let a style-anchor code (an exemplar's internal label) appear as a
  `\cite{}` in the paper.

## 6. Cross-references

- Manual `\ref{}` with a capitalized, typed type word and a tie:
  `Theorem~\ref{thm:foo}`, `Lemma~\ref{lem:bar}`, `Section~\ref{sec:baz}`.
- Never `\cref`, `\Cref`, `\autoref`, or `\hyperref` for cross-references.
- Equations: `\eqref{eq:foo}` (which already prints the parentheses); never
  write `Equation~\eqref{...}`.
- Label consistently by type: `thm:`, `lem:`, `prop:`, `cor:`, `defn:`, `eq:`,
  `sec:`, `fig:`, `table:`.

## 7. Sentence-level style

- Compact sentences, roughly one mathematical claim each. Prefer short.
- No em-dashes.
- Avoid filler and false-rigor adverbs: *clearly, obviously, trivially,
  straightforward, evidently, of course*. If a step is easy, either show the
  one line or cite it; if it is not, do not claim it is.
- Avoid vague register verbs in implication contexts: *we infer, we demonstrate,
  produces/produce* (as logical implication), *for brevity* (in proof prose),
  *one has*. Prefer *we prove, we show, it follows that, hence, therefore*.
- Vary consequence connectives (`Thus`, `Hence`, `Therefore`, `So`) rather than repeating one; rotating also helps avoid LaTeX bad line breaks. Reserve `In particular` for consequences that are genuinely a punchline or carry independent interest; for routine consequences use `As a consequence` or no connector. Use `Indeed` only to introduce explanatory or contextual elaboration, never as a one-line stand-in for a proof step.
- The abstract opens with `We prove ...` or a close variant (not "In this paper,
  we ..."), carries no `\cite{}`, and keeps notation to at most `$\mathbb{Q}$` /
  `$\mathbb{R}$` / numerics — anything heavier is paraphrased into words.
- Replace handwave phrases ("the machinery", "the previous step", "as before",
  "in the obvious way") with a formula, a citation, or a forward reference.

## 8. Environments and structure

- An Introduction that orients the reader: context, the headline statement(s),
  their relation to prior work, and a short roadmap. Each introduction
  subsection opens with a reader-orienting sentence and, when multi-paragraph,
  closes with a signal sentence.
- A Preliminaries / Notation section collecting standing conventions, set up
  once and referenced thereafter.
- Definitions in `\begin{defn}`; notation in a notation environment; setups that
  several later statements inherit in a `\begin{setup}`-style environment.
- Every construction, lemma, proposition, theorem, definition, or corollary lives in its own labeled environment with a `\label`, never as bare prose or a bold paragraph header. Promote based on a section's primary mathematical content, not its title: if a section's job is to prove one claim, state that claim as a labeled `\begin{lem}`/`\begin{prop}`/`\begin{thm}` at the top, then give the proof. The reason is referenceability — a later section can only cite a result that has an environment and a `\label`; bare prose cannot be `\ref`'d.
- Figures/tables: float with `[!htbp]`, a tight `fig:`/`table:` label, a
  one-sentence caption ending in a period; prefer TikZ for diagrams.

## 9. Anti-patterns (do not do these)

- Compressing or paraphrasing away mathematical content under the guise of style.
- Dropping or downgrading a citation to a weasel phrase; narrative author-year
  attribution in the body.
- A fabricated or unverified `\bibitem` treated as published; right title with
  wrong/guessed authors; invented venue, year, pagination, or arXiv id.
- `\varepsilon`, em-dashes, `\cref`/`\autoref`, BibTeX, `Equation~\eqref{...}`.
- Naked symbols in a headline statement; symbol-prefixed theorem titles.
- Filler adverbs standing in for justification.
- A bibliography sorted by label string instead of by author surname.
- Any internal pipeline identifier, codename, fact id, or hash in visible output.
